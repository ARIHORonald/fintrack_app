## Project Description
**FinTrack** is a personal finance management application aimed at helping Gen Z users (born between 1997-2012) effectively manage their finances, track spending, and achieve financial goals. Built primarily using PHP and Bootstrap for responsive design, FinTrack emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, providing an intuitive user experience with tools to help users take control of their financial habits.

### Current Phase: Expense Tracking and Budget Management
In this initial phase of FinTrack, we are focusing on providing core budgeting and expense-tracking features. These foundational tools allow users to:
- **Log Daily Expenses:** Enter daily expenses, including the name, category, date, and amount.
- **Categorize Expenses:** Sort and view expenses by category to gain insights into spending patterns.
- **Set Monthly Budgets:** Establish monthly spending limits and track expenses against these budgets.
- **Expense Overview:** View a sortable list of all expenses by date or category for easy tracking.
- **Edit and Delete Entries:** Update or remove entries for accurate financial records.

### Future Development
FinTrack has ambitious goals for upcoming phases, which will introduce advanced features that harness the power of AI and machine learning. Planned future enhancements include:
- **AI-Driven Budgeting and Goal Setting:** Machine learning algorithms will analyze spending habits, suggest budgets, and help users set and achieve specific financial goals, such as saving for a major purchase or paying off loans.
- **Interactive Financial Education Modules:** To address the need for financial literacy among Gen Z, FinTrack will include engaging educational content, quizzes, and simulations on fundamental financial concepts.
- **Peer-to-Peer Payment Integration:** This feature will integrate with popular payment platforms, enabling users to split bills, manage shared expenses, and transfer funds easily.
- **Gamified Savings Challenges:** To encourage savings, FinTrack will feature gamified challenges with rewards for achieving goals, making financial management fun and motivational.
- **Subscription Management:** A tool to track and manage recurring subscriptions, helping users identify unnecessary expenses and potential savings.
